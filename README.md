- Introduction to Face Detection in Video Files

 - Detecting faces in video files is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling applications from security surveillance to facial recognition systems. This face detection app uses OpenCV in C++ to analyze video frames, identify faces, and provide real-time feedback on the number of faces detected.

- Key Features:

 - OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV's robust library for image processing and face detection algorithms.
 - Video File Compatibility: Works seamlessly with video files, allowing for batch processing and detailed analysis.
 - Real-time Feedback: Displays the number of faces detected in each frame, enhancing situational awareness.
 - Easy Setup: Compile and run with simple commands, leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of C++.
 - To comple : g++ test.cpp -o main `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
 - To run : ./main
